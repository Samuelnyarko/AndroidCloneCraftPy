# Android Backup and Restore Utility
This repository contains Python scripts for backing up data from an Android device and restoring it to another device using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). It provides a simple interface to backup applications, shared storage, and app data, and then restore it on a new device.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
- USB debugging enabled on the Android devices
## Installation
1.	Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2.	Navigate to the repository directory:
## Usage
3.	### Backup
1. Connect your old Android device to your computer via USB.
2. Enable USB debugging on the device.
3. Run the backup script:
python backup.py
4.	 Confirm the backup on your device if prompted.
### Restore
1. Connect your new Android device to your computer via USB.
2. Enable USB debugging on the device.
3. Run the restore script:
python restore.py
5.	 Confirm the restore on your device if prompted.
## Scripts
- `backup.py`: This script backs up data from the connected Android device.
- `restore.py`: This script restores data to the connected Android device using a previously created backup file.

## Notes
- The backup script does not encrypt the backup data. Handle your backup file with care.
- Some apps may opt-out of the Android backup service and therefore will not be included in the backup.
- Restoring data will overwrite existing data on the device. Proceed with caution.
- Ensure the ADB version is compatible with your Android devices.
