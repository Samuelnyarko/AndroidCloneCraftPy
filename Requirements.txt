# Requirements for Android Backup and Restore Utility

# Python Standard Libraries (No external Python packages are required):
# - subprocess
# - os
# - time

# External Requirements:

# 1. ADB (Android Debug Bridge):
#    - Windows: Download the SDK Platform Tools from https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
#    - MacOS/Linux: Use a package manager like Homebrew (Mac) or apt (Linux).
#    - Extract the downloaded file and add the 'platform-tools' directory to your PATH.

# 2. Android USB Drivers (for Windows users):
#    - Visit https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb and follow the instructions to download and install the USB driver for your specific device.
#    - Ensure that the drivers are correctly installed and that your device is recognised by your system.

# Note: USB debugging must be enabled on Android devices for these scripts to work.
#  This can usually be done in the Developer Options in the Android Settings.
